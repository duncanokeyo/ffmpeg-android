Build ffmpeg for android


Use build_all.sh file to run the build script, to build for armeabi-v7a, x86 android architectures.
You can also change the individual architecture build configs to your liking. The current configuration will creates shared(.so)
files totaling less than 6mb for each architecture.
The various (.so) files can be found under "android/(architecture)/lib"
